# A valid postal code P have to fullfil both below requirements:

# P must be a number in the range from 100000 to 999999 inclusive.
# P must not contain more than one alternating repetitive digit pair.
# Alternating repetitive digits are digits which repeat immediately after the next digit. In other words, an alternating repetitive digit pair is formed by two equal digits that have just a single digit between them.

# For example:

# 121426 # Here, 1 is an alternating repetitive digit.
# 523563 # Here, NO digit is an alternating repetitive digit.
# 552523 # Here, both 2 and 5 are alternating repetitive digits.

# Your task is to provide two regular expressions 
# regex_integer_in_range and 
# regex_alternating_repetitive_digit_pair. Where:

# regex_integer_in_range should match only integers range from 100000 to 999999 inclusive
# regex_alternating_repetitive_digit_pair should find alternating repetitive digits pairs in a given string.
# Both these regular expressions will be used by the provided code template to check if the input string P is a valid postal code using the following expression:

# (bool(re.match(regex_integer_in_range, P)) 
# and 
# len(re.findall(regex_alternating_repetitive_digit_pair, P)) < 2)

# Input Format
# Locked stub code in the editor reads a single string denoting P from stdin and uses provided expression and your regular expressions to validate if P is a valid postal code.

# Output Format
# You are not responsible for printing anything to stdout. Locked stub code in the editor does that.

# Sample Input 0
# 110000

# Sample Output 0
# False

# Explanation 0
# 1 1 0000 : (0, 0) and (0, 0) are two alternating digit pairs. Hence, it is an invalid postal code.

# Note:
# A score of  will be awarded for using 'if' conditions in your code.
# You have to pass all the testcases to get a positive score.
